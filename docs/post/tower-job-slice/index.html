          <h4>Scaling Ansible Tower - Job slicing</h4>
          <p>
           
          </p>
          <p>

<p>Ansible Tower is a centralised platform for running and controlling your Ansible automation. It provides a number of key features for running Ansible in the enterprise.</p>

<ol>
<li>Role-Based Access Control</li>
<li>Inventory Management</li>
<li>Credential Management</li>
<li>Auditing &amp; Logging</li>
<li>Clustering &amp; Scale-Out</li>
</ol>

<p>Job slicing is a new scale-out feature that was introduced in Ansible Tower 3.4 which allows us to run jobs that are distributed across our Ansible Tower cluster. Before we look at job slicing let&rsquo;s quickly look at  clustering and job distribution within a cluster.</p>

<h4 id="ansible-tower-clustering">Ansible Tower clustering</h4>

<p>Ansible Tower can be installed in a cluster to provide a highly available platform for running Ansible. A clustered install provides scale-out capabilities in that different jobs are scheduled across Tower nodes to ensure they are sharing the load. However, each individual job is run on a single Tower node only. If I run a job against 1000&rsquo;s of servers then a single Tower node runs this job and it must have enough capacity to run this job in a timely fashion. Let&rsquo;s look at how we calculate concurrency and capacity in Ansible Tower.</p>

<h4 id="calculating-capacity">Calculating Capacity</h4>

<p>Ansible uses forks to determine how many hosts to automate against in parallel. By default 5 forks are spawned but we can override this if we are automating against a large number of hosts. For example, I may run a configuration management playbook every 1 hour to ensure my hosts are in a desired state. If I run that playbook against 1000&rsquo;s of nodes with only 5 forks then this will take some time to complete.</p>

<p>We can calculate the number of available forks based on memory capacity or cpu capacity depending on the nature of the workload.</p>

<p><strong>memory capacity</strong></p>

<p>Protecting memory capacity is the default configuration and allows us to overcommit cpu while ensuring we don&rsquo;t run out of memory. To calculate the number of forks we remove 2048MB memory for the running of Tower services and then divide the remaining available memory by <strong>mem_per_fork</strong> - which defaults to 100MB:</p>

<p><code>(mem - 2048) / mem_per_fork</code></p>

<p>For a Tower node with 4GB memory this results in a capacity of around 20 forks:</p>

<p><code>(4096 - 2048) / 100 = 20</code></p>

<p><strong>cpu capacity</strong></p>

<p>For cpu capacity we multiply the number of cpus by <em>fork_per_cpu</em> - which defaults to 4.</p>

<p><code>cpus * fork_per_cpu</code></p>

<p>For a Tower node with 4 cores:</p>

<p><code>4 * 4 = 16</code></p>

<p>If I were to run a job with more forks than the calculated capacity, then I run the risk of performance issues or running out of resources on my Tower nodes.</p>

<h4 id="job-slicing">Job Slicing</h4>

<p>As previously mentioned, when a job is launched in Ansible Tower, it is executed on a single node in the cluster. So effectively, ansible-playbook is run from a single node. This means that a job is limited to the number of forks on a single Tower node. If we are executing a playbook across a large number of hosts then we are not making use of all of the available capacity in our cluster.</p>

<p>Job slicing is a new feature of Ansible Tower 3.4 and helps to address this issue. Job slicing allows us to distribute a job across multiple Tower nodes. It does this by splitting the inventory into slices. A workflow is then created for us with multiple instances of our job being run on each slice of our inventory. For example, if I have 30 nodes in my inventory and I decide to create 3 slices then a workflow is created with three jobs - each being executed on 10 nodes in parallel. Obviously, I need 3 Tower nodes in this example so that my three job slices can be executed across the three hosts.</p>

<h4 id="using-job-slices">Using job slices</h4>

<p>To demonstrate job slicing, I have a three node Tower cluster. My inventory contains 49 hosts for me to automate against. Here is the available capacity in forks reported by my hosts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tower capacity.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My Tower hosts can each safely spawn up to 27 forks based on memory capacity. If we look at the following job template we can see that I have specified 30 forks - I run the risk of exhausting memory resources. Also note that I only have one job slice configured - this is the default when creating a new job template.</p>

<p><img src="/images/job template 1 slice.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When I launch my job we can see that my playbook is being run on a single Tower node. As I have allocated more forks than I safely have capacity for I am over-allocated on capacity. My other two Tower nodes are just relaxing at this point with no work scheduled on them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/1 slice capacity.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll re-configure my job template so that it utilises three slices.</p>

<p><img src="/images/job template 3 slices.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This time when I launch my job template, a worklfow is automatically generated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/job slice workflow finished.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If we look at one of the individual jobs within the workflow we can see that this is slice job 1 of 3. Also, note that this job is being run on a &ldquo;slice&rdquo; of my inventory - 16 hosts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/job output.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, we can see that capacity is now being utilised across all three of my Tower nodes.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>Job slices provide an additional method for scaling Ansible automation with Ansible Tower. By default, jobs are distributed across Tower nodes in a cluster but each individual job is only ever run from a single Tower node. Job slicing allows us to split a single job so that it is run across multiple nodes to provide additional scale-out capacity.</p>
