      <title>Ansible Tower Dynamic Inventories - Manage Enabled Hosts</title>

      <description>If you have used dynamic inventories in Ansible Tower before, you may have noticed that it adds some logic to determine whether a host should be enabled for job execution or not. For example, when syncing with our Red Hat Virtualisation environment, it has set some of our hosts to disabled.
Why do we get this behaviour? In the case of Red Hat Virtualisation you can probably tell from the screen shot - Tower will disable any VM&amp;rsquo;s which are powered off and we can see the VM&amp;rsquo;s which are disabled show a state of &amp;ldquo;status_down&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In this blog post we will look at how we can easily enrich an existing dynamic inventory using the constructed inventory plugin. But, before we do that, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back.
Ansible is simple automation tool that allows users to achieve common use cases such as configuration management, provisioning and complex multi-tier orchestration. Part of what makes Ansible so simple, is the fact that it is agentless. One doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to deploy agents or any heavyweight control software to get up and running with Ansible automation.</description>
