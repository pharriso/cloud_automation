      <description>Molecule is a tool to aid with the testing and development of Ansible roles. It allows users to spin up test infrastructure to provide a quick and easy means with which to test Ansible roles. Typically the test instances are containers as they are lightweight and typically very fast to create and destroy. There are a number of posts out there that describe the process of using molecule with containers but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find many that describe the process for testing molecule with Virtual Machines.</description>
