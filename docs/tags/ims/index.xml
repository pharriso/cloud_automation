      <description>While VMware is undoubtedly a great virtualisation offering (I spent a number of users working with VMware tech) some customers are looking beyond traditional virtualisation. The growing adoption of containerisation is a great example of this and using RHV as a stepping stone to Container Native Virtualisation (CNV) is a good example use case.
Other customers simply want to save costs and are looking at alternative virtualisation offerings. Whatever the reason for moving from VMware, we need a method for migrating workloads to RHV.</description>
